# IPL-Data-Analysis



## ***DataSets:***

The Data sets used for this project are added to this folder. 

We used two data files. They are: 
* deliveries.csv - Contains ball by ball data from 2008 to 2019
* matches.csv    - Contains match by match data from 2008 to 2019

Data Sources: We have collected above datasets from the below websites.
* CricSheet.org
* IPL T20 Official website


## ***Source Code:***

Source Code is written in python.

We used Google Collab for executing our project. 

The following model was analyzed based on features such as Teams, Pitch, and derived features such as each batsman's performance against the opposing team:

Runs Prediction: The model was trained to predict the runs of each team, which was then used to determine the winning team.

Ball by Ball: The model was trained on ball-by-ball data and used to predict the winning rate. SVR was able to accurately predict runs scored during the 11-20 overs.

Ball by Ball: The model was trained on data only from the 11-20 overs and used to predict the winning rate. By considering the average runs scored, the winning rate prediction was improved.

Based on these analyses, it was found that the winning rate prediction is most accurate when using data from the 11-20 overs and considering average runs scored.
